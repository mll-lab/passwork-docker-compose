# Install Passwork using Docker Compose 

Based upon https://github.com/passwork-me/docker

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Setup

Clone this repository onto your production server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mll-lab/passwork-docker-compose.git passwork
```

Now initialize and update the actual site as a submodule.

```bash
git submodule init && git submodule update
```

This configuration enforces the use of SSL. Put your certificate and key under:
- `conf/ssl/prod.crt`
- `conf/ssl/prod.key`

Run the setup script:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The app should be up and running shortly thereafter. Check the status with

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

Open the page in your browser to get to the Sign Up page.

This user will become the owner and administrator of your installation.
Click `Upload keys` and select `.lic` and `reginfo.json` file.

## Usage

Start the application

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Stop the application

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Interactive shell into a container

```bash
docker-compose exec web sh
```

## Mail Configuration

Postfix is used to send emails.

You can edit the configuration files that are stored at `conf/postfix`
   
Donâ€™t forget to reload Postfix to apply changes:

```bash
docker-compose exec web service postfix reload
```

## Backup

Read how backup's generally work [in the Backups manual](https://github.com/passwork-me/manuals-en/blob/master/Backups.md)

You can execute the `mongodump` and `mongorestore` commands within the web container

```bash
docker-compose exec web mongodump
```
